/**
 * Annotation allowing for customizing
 * 1. the id identifying which concrete subtype of an ADT is encoded/to be decoded
 * 2. the name of case class members (de)serialized with [[MapBasedCodecs]]
 *
 * USE CASE 1: Type Ids
 * --------------------
 *
 * By default the derived encoders and decoders for ADTs serialize the short class name of an
 * ADT instance in order to let the decoder now, which subtype to deserialize.
 *
 * This notation allows for customizing the type id that is used to identify an ADT sub-type
 * in the encoding and offers two choices: A [[String]] or an integer number ([[Int]]/[[Long]]) value.
 * (The latter is not supported in JSON and will cause any encoding attempt to fail with an exception!)
 *
 * Relying on strings makes the serialization more descriptive but is more verbose on the wire.
 * Relying on numbers makes the serialization very compact but less descriptive.
 *
 * If necessary styles could also be mixed within a single ADT, even though this is not recommended
 * (for consistency/clarity only, there is no technical reason).
 *
 * The following example shows such an (otherwise not recommended) mixed setup for illustrating the
 * different style of using this annotation for type ids:
 *
 * {{{
 *   sealed trait Animal
 *   object Animal {
 *     @key("D") // default would be "Dog", but we want sth shorter
 *     final case class Dog(name: String, age: Int)
 *
 *     @key(2)
 *     final case class Cat(name: String, age: Int, weight: Option[Double])
 *
 *     // if no @TypeId is given, the short type name is used, in this case "Mouse"
 *     final case class Mouse(name: String, size: Int)
 *   }
 * }}}
 *
 * USE CASE 2: Member Names
 * ------------------------
 *
 * By default [[MapBasedCodecs]] use the case class member name as map key, which is usually a good default.
 * (Note: This will also work with backtick-ed member names as in ``case class(`type`: Int, `foo-bar`: String)``).
 *
 * However, sometimes it's convenient to be able to map the case class member to another name (and vice versa).
 * This annotation allows for just that.
 * As already described above (USE CASE 1) the annotation can take a [[String]] or an integer number ([[Int]]/[[Long]])
 * value as key. Mixing the two different styles in one class is allowed but not recommended.
 * JSON only supports [[String]] keys.
 *
 * This annotation is ignored by [[ArrayBasedCodecs]].
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * {{{
 *   case class Cat(name: String, age: Int, @key("weight") kilos: Option[Double])
 * }}}
